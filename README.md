# kahoot-numbers

Allows you to use buttons to select answers on kahoot
THe program is a desktop app made with Java (yes, it should be a browser extension but I don't know how to make). It will ask you to click on where the buttons are and when you clikc 1, 2, 3 or 4 it will automatically click on the corresponding button.
